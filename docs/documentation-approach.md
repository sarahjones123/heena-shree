# Documentation Approach

I approach documentation as a structured system that supports:

- Product usability  
- Operational efficiency  
- Compliance readiness  
- Scalable knowledge management  

## Core Principles

- Task-based structure  
- Controlled terminology  
- Clear hierarchy  
- Minimal cognitive load  
- Logical information architecture  

Documentation should reduce support dependency and enable confident user interaction.
